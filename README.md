## What is this?

This repo is an **unofficial** MediaTek "feeds" for [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org "OpenWrt") or [Lede](https://lede-project.org). This project is experimental, and technical support will be limited.

In OpenWrt/Lede, a ["feeds"](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/feeds "feeds") is a collection of software components (applications, libraries, kernel-modules, ...) that you can integrate into your OpenWrt/Lede system.

## How can I use them?

I assume that you already have a working OpenWrt/Lede workspace, then add the following line into "feeds.conf.default" (You will find it under the top dir of your workspace).

    src-git mtk https://github.com/Nossiac/mtk-openwrt-feeds;lede-17.01

then execute:

	scripts/feeds update -f mtk
	scripts/feeds install -a -p mtk

Now you will be able to see extra packages via `make menuconfig`. All packages from this feeds are located under `MTK Properties`.

## What do we have here?

### mt7620/mt7610/mt7612/mt7628/mt7603/mt7615

These are prebuilt WiFi modules for OpenWrt/Lede, including:

* mt7620 (done)
* mt7628 (done)
* mt7610 (done)
* mt7602 (done)
* mt7612 (done)
* mt7603 (done)
* mt7615 (done)

You can download all available wifi modules here:
[http://nossiac.com/download/mtk-wifi-ko/](http://nossiac.com/download/mtk-wifi-ko/) . The are named as:

	<wifichip>-for-<cpuname>-linux-<kernel-version>.ko

A detailed document for using these WiFi modules is here:
[about-mtk-wifi.md](https://github.com/Nossiac/mtk-openwrt-feeds/blob/master/about-mtk-wifi.md) .

### uci2dat

An application that translates "/etc/config/wireless" into MTK's WiFi profiles (e.g. mt7620.dat). You may use it as an adapter to make MTK's WiFi drivers work with standard LuCi's WiFi management.

### wificonf

An application that reads/writes configuration files with "<Key>=[Value]" syntax. It can be used in your own scripts to help manipulate MTK WiFi profiles.

If you use lua, you should take a look at:
[https://github.com/Nossiac/mtk-openwrt-feeds/blob/master/mtk-luci-plugin/luci-app-mtkwifi/root/usr/lib/lua/mtkwifi.lua](https://github.com/Nossiac/mtk-openwrt-feeds/blob/master/mtk-luci-plugin/luci-app-mtkwifi/root/usr/lib/lua/mtkwifi.lua).

### mtk-nvram

The term "nvram" in MTK's software means a raw storage scheme on flash chips. It access flash device in raw mode (without filesystem). 

All data stored in nvram partition are "<Key>=[Value]" pairs. It usually resides in mtd partition "config". 

Noteï¼š OpenWrt/Lede has replaced nvram scheme with [uci](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci) long ago. I keep this for back compatibility only. 

### mtk-luci-plugin

This is a plugin for LuCI web interface, which manipulates MTK's proprietary drivers by reading/writing its profile directly. It does not use uci, so "/etc/config/wireless" is left untouched.

To use it, you should install LuCI first:

	scripts/feeds update
	scripts/feeds install luci

Also we have a small tool called "web console" along with the plugin, it exposes root shell to the web interface, and sometimes you may need it. 

## Technical support? 

I do this in my spare time, so I cannot promise too much. Anyway, you are welcome to feedback any issues/bugs/suggestions/patches here. That would be helpful for MTK to improve what they are doing.
